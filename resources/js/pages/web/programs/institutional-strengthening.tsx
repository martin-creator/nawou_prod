                            This deliberate effort amplifies unified voices to champion and advance gender equality in Uganda.Â  <br />
                            1. Convener: Bringing together women-focused organizations to advocate and implement interventions that improve the lives
                            of women and girls in Uganda. This includes creating Communities of Practice (CoPs) for member organizations to share
                            experiences and expertise. <br />
                            2. Communicator: Advocating for women's and girls' issues, amplifying member organizations' work, and generating research
                            and evidence to inform policy makers and stakeholders. This involves organizing conferences, workshops, and virtual
                            meetings. <br />
                            3. Capacity Builder: Developing the capacity of member organizations to advance the gender agenda sustainably. This
                            includes conducting organizational capacity assessments, providing training, and supporting program strategy, design, and
                            implementation. <br />
                            To achieve these roles, NAWOU requires a strong secretariat with the right capacities to support its performance and
                            membership across Uganda.
